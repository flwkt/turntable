## Protect your assets

You can use the `data-turntable-short` attribute to hide the actual path to your GLB/GLTF file to hide your 3D assets from the public.

See [data-turntable-short](#data-turntable-short) in the settings section below for more information.

## Settings

### `data-turntable-file`

The URL of the GLB/GLTF file to load.

### `data-turntable-count`

The number of images to generate from the GLB/GLTF file.

For example, if you set `data-turntable-count="14"` then the 360Â° view will be split into 14 images.

It's recommended to set `data-turntable-count` as small as posiible because all images need to be loaded on your users device.

Currently the maximum is 20 images.

### `data-turntable-scroll`

if `true` the turntable will rotate automatically when the user scrolls and the image is in the viewport.

### `data-turntable-lazy`

if `true` the images will be loaded lazily.

This is a beta feature right now and leads to flickering.


### `data-turntable-rv`

The vertical rotation of the images. Example: 
- `0` means the camera looks straight at the model.
- `90` means the camera looks at the model from the top.
- `-90` means the camera looks at the model from the bottom.

default is `15`.

### `data-turntable-short`

The short URL of the GLB/GLTF file to load.

This can be used to hide the actual path to your GLB/GLTF file to hide your assets from the public.

You can get the short URL from the API response of `https://www.flowkit.app/api/short?url=URL_TO_YOUR_GLB_OR_GLTF_FILE`.

For example:

https://www.flowkit.app/api/short?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/main/2.0/Suzanne/glTF/Suzanne.gltf
